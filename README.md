# ZeldaLinksAwakeningMap

An interactive map for The Legend Of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX for the GameBoy Colour

I started this project mainly to teach myself tiled layouts with HTML and CSS. It's inspired by [this old clickable map](http://portfolio16.de/zelda/map4/map_en.htm) which I found via an interesting [3D modelling project](http://mithosk-games.blogspot.co.uk/2010/02/3d-links-awakening-dungeon-update-248.html) from years ago. I wanted to update the original's pure HTML to use modern CSS positioning and use [image maps](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_imagemap.asp) to make just the doors clickable, not the whole tile.

### Tools

I downloaded all the tiles with [a Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/image-downloader/cnpniohnfphhjihaiiggeabnkjhpaldj) \
I intend to try this project with other retro game maps by tile-cropping with [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)
